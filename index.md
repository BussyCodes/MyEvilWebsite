## My Wicked Website

Hello all! To the international community, my codename is Bussy, but my true name is Dr. Ruth Buskirk. Here in my blog, I discuss anything and everything -- including but not limited to: recent nefarious scams, travel, and food.

Guys, I did it. I took the world's supply of those cookies. They're all mine. Nobody can take them away from me now. NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMN HAHAHAHAHAHA

I've gotten the weirdest of cravings recently -- every time I pass these cookies when I went to Walmart, I have this inexplicable urge to buy them. It's odd because I know how bad they are for you. On another note, the boyfriend of a student of mine developed a chrome extension and I tried it out! It's pretty cool, and I could see myself using it in the future.

There was a really interesting experiment I conducted at the lab yesterday. First, I dunked some **litmus paper in an acidic solution**. Also, a shipment of **Tartrazine** came today that I'm looking forward to using in the future. Then, because I was feeling particularly nefarious, I lit some **copper on fire** (yes I know that releases toxic fumes but I absolutely love the color!).  **I just love the beautiful colors of chemistry**.

I just started this blog, hoping that this could be a good outlet to express my feelings. Even if nobody reads this, at least it'll do me some good. Bussy out!
